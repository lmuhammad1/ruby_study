# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.
# assigned a string to the variable 'days'
days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
# assigned a string with \n to variable 'months'
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

# print a string along with the contents of the variable 'days'
puts "Here are the days: ", days
# print a string along with the contents of the variable 'months'
# and each month displays on a new line because of '\n'
puts "Here are the months: ", months

# print a complete paragraph with multiple lines between PARAGRAPH
puts <<PARAGRAPH
There's something going on here.
With the PARAGRAPH thing
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
PARAGRAPH
